          Our client thought he hired us to build an iPad app for the lower to middle class customers of his prepaid
          debit card. But what we quickly realized was that the entire customer journey had to be unpacked,
          understood, and transformed to deliver on the company’s aspiration to be the Southwest Airlines of
          banking: simple, trustworthy, and value-driven.
          </br>
          We brought to life several concepts that spanned across this journey. Every single idea had to
          embody and reinforce those three key attributes to build awareness and subsequent loyalty&#8212; from the
          packaging to the account holder’s homepage, our ideas complemented each other, but were also
          impactful alone.
          </br>
          Additionally, we had to design around elements over which we had
          little control. Through extensive channel visits, user research, and iteration, we ensured our concepts
          made sense within the broader retail and financial context. For instance, we created bold packaging to draw
          attention on a crowded rack. We also investigated mechanisms and applications that went
          beyond supporting basic financial transactions to ones that addressed the financial aspirations of the
          customers.
